#  Prediction of an American adult view toward computers algorithm based on the data collected from a Pew Research Center Survey conducted in 2018


## SUMMARY 
Predict an American view towards computer decisions

        2018 PEW RESEARCH CENTER'S AMERICAN TRENDS PANEL

## JUSTIFICATION
Nowadays, we are observing an considerable development of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. Computer decisions are running our life: the recommendation of a simple book to read or finding our next travel destinations are the results of algorithms based on our past behaviors. Analysts expect that people will become even more dependent on networked artificial intelligence (AI) in complex digital systems. Hence, different sectors raise the concern about impact of AI on production and free will of human being. Before getting to these concerns, a couple of questions are worth asking: How do we perceive computer decisions? Is that perception explained by our demographic profiles and habits? Hence, the purpose of this research which will be try to answer the previous questions on machine learning with .. machine learning based on some classification models.

## OBJECTIVES
This work is purely an academic research - an individual project on classification for the Data Science bootcamp at Flatiron School. It was a good opportunity for me to use this project to work on a subject that we talked about on a daily basis to build my Data Science portfolio.
Otherwise, I want to find out:
How social and demographic behavior of an individual can help predict is view towards computer decisions? 

## HYPOTHESIS
2 main hypothses will guide my work:

1. Based on an adult profiles and social media behaviors, we can determine his attitudes towards computer algorithms

2. Social and economic profiles (income, ethnicity, education) are more likely to influence the perception towards computer decisions.


## METHODOLOGY
The study will be done using Python. I will use mainly the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, SciPy. 
The data 
Data Cleaning
Transformation
